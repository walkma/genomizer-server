!Series_summary	"This submission comes from a modENCODE project of Gary Karpen. For full list of modENCODE projects, see http://www.genome.gov/26524648"
!Series_summary	"Project Goal: We aim to determine the locations of 125 chromosomal proteins across the Drosophila melanogaster genome. The proteins under study are involved in basic chromosomal functions such as DNA replication, gene expression, gene silencing, and inheritance. We will perform Chromatin ImmunoPrecipitation (ChIP) using the Illumina NGS platform. We will initially assay localizations using chromatin from three cell lines and two embryonic stages, and will then extend the analysis of a subset of proteins to four additional animal tissues/stages"

Transfer supernatants to new tubes. Add 5ml of 100mM PMSF solution in isopropanol to each 500ml aliquot of precleared chromatin.   3. Add appropriate amount of antibody to each reaction. Do not forget to set up no Ab control. Incubate for 15 hours at +40C on rotating weel.   4. Add 40ml of PAS (50% suspension in RIPA (-PMSF)), incubate 3h at +40C on rotating weel.   5. Wash the beads 5 times 10min each with 1ml of RIPA, then one time with 1ml of LiCl ChIP buffer and finally twice with 1ml of TE. To pellet the beads between washes spin samples for 20sec +40C at top speed. Do all the washes at +40C.   6. Resuspend the beads in 100ml TE add 1ml (final 50mg/ml) of RNAse A (10mg/ml) incubate 30min at +370C.   7. Add 7.5ml (final 0.5%) of 10% SDS and 3.8ml (final 0.5mg/ml) of Proteinase K (20mg/ml). Incubate overnight at +370C.   8. Transfer samples at +650C, incubate 6h.   9. Add 4.5ml of 5M NaCl (140mM final).

Bowtie is an ultrafast, memory-efficient short read aligner geared toward quickly aligning large sets of short DNA sequences (reads) to large genomes.Reads that passed default parameters of the Illumina quality filter were mapped with Bowtie 0.12.7. The reference sequence used to built an index for mapping was the Flybase reference r5.22. The reference index was created using the bowtie-build function with default parameters. Reads were mapped using  -n 2 -l 28 -e 70 -k 1 -m 10 --best in Bowtie (-n 2, -l 28, -e 70 default). Parameters-n INT number of allowed mismatch-l INT seed length-e INT maximum permitted total of quality values at all mismatched read positions-m INT suppress all alignments for a particular read or pair if more than INT reportable alignments-k INT report up to INT valid alignments--best report alignments in best-to worst orderReads were converted to SAM formant using the bowtie2sam.pl script provided by the DCC. SPP Peak calling protocol. The aligned reads were called using SPP R package (ver.1.10, Kharchenko et al., Nat.Biotech 2008). The binding characteristics and tag shift were estimated using SPP get.binding.characteristics() function. The reads showing abnormality were removed using SPP remove.local.tag.anomalies() function. The regions of enrichment were identified as continuous blocks of positions that exhibit significant enrichment of IP over input reads. The significance of enrichment was assessed within a 1Kb window around each point using a Poisson model. A position was considered significantly enriched if the number of IP read counts was significantly higher (Z-score > 3) than the number of input read counts, after adjusting for the total number of reads sequenced in IP and input measurements. For each replicate set, if replicates were consistent (>80% agreement for top 40% of peaks/enrichment clusters), reads in each replicates were combined and enrichment regions were called as described above.  Processed data are obtained using following parameters: genome version is FlyBase r5"
